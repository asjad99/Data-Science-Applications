Just as in 2008, the bankers lied.

This time, the central bankers, the banks, and the bank regulators have lied to all dollar holders and depositors.

This isn't your typical fractional reserve situation. The problem is that there isn't enough in the banks on a mark-to-market basis to cover withdrawals. They knew this through all of last year, and communicated it internally in their coded language.

It's obvious from the graphs (see below). The central banks, the banks, and the banking regulators all knew a huge crash was coming — the phrase is "unrealized losses" [1,2,3,4,5]. But they never notified you, the depositor.

Instead the regulators allowed banks to hide their literal insolvency in footnotes[6], until one guy figured it out[7].

It's Uncle Sam Bankman Fried. Just like SBF used your deposits to buy shitcoins, using accounting tricks to fool himself and others into using the money, so too did the banks.

They all used the deposits to buy the ultimate shitcoin: long-dated US Treasuries. And they all got rekt at the same time, in the same way, because they bought the same asset from the same vendor who devalued it at the same time: the Fed.

Specifically, as NYT admitted, banks "binged" on enormous amounts of Treasuries and other long-term bonds in 2021 when the flood of printed money cut off their typical demand for loans, and because they thought the Fed would keep interest rates low forever.[8].

And they had good reason to believe this. Powell said he'd be "patient" on rate hikes as late as Nov 3 2021[9]. Then he got renominated on Nov 22 2021[10], and hiked rates much faster than anyone had expected — which even Yellen[11] and the FDIC[12] admit caused the current banking crisis.

Why did Powell delay? Probably for political reasons. Presidents don't like rate hikes[13], especially running into the election year of 2022. And Powell thought he could wait and just be like Paul Volcker[14], who was "firm" and then defeated inflation.

But the world isn't an 80s rerun. Hiking from ten years of near zero interest rates in the 2010s was a surprise attack on every dollar holder. Economics isn't politics - the kind of insane flipflops you see in politics don't work when there are actual contracts involved.

So anyone who bet on long-term Treasuries got killed in 2021. And now, anyone who bets on short-term Treasuries is going to get killed in 2023. The absolute worse place you can be is to have large amounts of assets locked up in three month treasury bills. The ~5% interest rate offered by big banks (G-SIBs) is a trap. Most fiat bank accounts are now a trap, for those countries whose central bankers followed the Fed.

Here are the remaining references, as Twitter has a limit on the number of links in one post.

I am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it'll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.

Terms of the bet: ideally someone can set up a smart contract where BTC is worth >$1M in 90 days, then I win. If it's worth less than $1M in 90 days, then the counterparty gets the $1M in USD.

HYPERBITCOINIZATION
We have to define hyperinflation in BTC vs USD terms because all other fiat currencies can and will be inflated away. That is hyperbitcoinization.

This is the moment that the world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century. What's going to happen is that individuals, then firms, then large funds will buy Bitcoin. Then sovereigns like El Salvador (
@nayibbukele
) and tiny crypto friendly countries.

The big move will be when a US state like Florida or Texas, or a "normal" country like Estonia, Singapore, Saudi, Hungary, or UAE buys BItcoin. And when 
@narendramodi
 tells India's central bank to buy Bitcoin, even as a hedge, it's over.

Why will it be so fast? Well, hyperinflation happens fast. We've seen digital pandemics (COVID), digital riots (BLM), and digital bank runs (SVB). Everything will happen very fast once people check what I'm saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.

The thing is, people are still tuned to an analog world where things get gradually worse rather than all at once. But there isn't much forewarning for a digital event — it's 1 and then it's 0. Just like the bank runs, except this is the central bank.

There are however two sources of forewarning. First is the chart of the long-term depreciation of USD vs BTC, from less than $1 USD per BTC to $25k USD per BTC. Much of the smart money has been voting against the dollar since the financial crisis. The end is a digital drop off a cliff, almost invisible on the chart — but highly visible in the world.

This tweet is the second forewarning. It'll be ignored and mocked by people who still trust the US establishment, even after the last few years. Who can't imagine that the US banks and media could be lying to them to this extent.

But they are. Just as they did in 2008, and over the last ten years. The digital devaluation of the dollar is coming and it's going to be intense.

PRINT TRILLIONS WHILE HIKING RATES

The Fed now has “high rates” like SF has “low crime rates”. It says it does, but it doesn’t.

Because you have to be pretty naive to think today’s rate hike means the Fed is still “fighting inflation”. You can see it in the graphs — the printing is already vertical[1,2], and trillions in new money is available for both domestic[3,4] and foreign[5] banks. Yet the Fed continues hiking rates to fool low information voters into thinking the last two weeks were just an isolated series of multi-hundred-billion dollar bank failures, and that their policy is unchanged. Nothing to worry about, the Western banking system is resilient, and it’s normal to have banks die at the rate of five in ten days![10]

Because that’s actually all this state does: it fakes the rates.

Remember when SF claimed officially low crime rates[6] even as criminals robbed stores in broad daylight[7]? Remember when FDA prevented labs from testing so we all underestimated the COVID infection rate[8], till old people in New York started dropping dead? And remember when the Fed claimed the inflation rate wouldn't be a problem[9] before anyone buying groceries found out it was an emergency?

The American state fakes the rates.

And that’s what’s happening with today’s “hike”. After killing five of their own banks[10], catalyzing a series of bank runs[11], and realizing the public now knew they’d made hundreds more banks insolvent[12,13], the Fed rolled out programs over the last two weeks that broke the normal relationship between “hiking rates” and “tightening monetary policy”.

All the losses the Fed rate hikes cause for domestic banks?
They’re printing money to cover it.[14]
All the losses they cause for foreign banks?
Printing money to cover that too.[15]
And the losses they cause for depositors?
Naturally, more printed money![16]

So now the banks don’t publicly die from bank runs. Instead, even as this rate hike keeps pushing bank stocks further into the ground[17], and banks further into insolvency[18], the banks know they can just get more printed money (eg at the discount window[19] for BTFP) to cover their losses. That’s what BTFP, the swap lines, and the effective “FedDIC” policy mean: infinite money.

And this infinite money is no longer abstract. It’s printed dollars that individuals touch directly when they wire their money out of banks they fear may collapse, which is happening everywhere from community banks[20] to Credit Suisse[21].  The money printer is now connected directly to your checking account. And in the digital era, the bank runs are of a historical scale.[22]

Remember also: the BTFP, swap lines, and FedDIC measures are *so enormous* that the Fed is doing them over weekends[23] with all the other central banks[24], and publishing multiple joint statements[25,26] assuring people that the “system is resilient”, even as Moody’s has downgraded the US banking system as a whole[27].

One of the things I hate about this system is that it’s evolved to be opaque, like a snake that’s evolved camouflage. If the Fed came outright and *said* they were digitally devaluing the dollar by printing trillions, that they were monetizing the debt as Dalio predicted[31] and even getting bondholders to abet the devaluation, everyone would flee for the Bitcoin exit. So instead they lie, to themselves and to others, just as Jean-Claude Juncker recommended[32].  As with CDOs[33] in 2008, the point is to fool themselves and to fool you.

But you have to see through the camouflage. They’re printing trillions[34,35] even as they’re hiking rates. Indeed, they’re printing trillions to compensate for the *consequences* of hiking rates. There will of course be other consequences to printing trillions. You can wait to find out, or you can get into Bitcoin now.

Figure: obviously, the big print to rescue these banks expands the balance sheet. And the more banks take up the Fed on the big print, the harder it is to maintain the fiction that they're still doing quantitative tightening.

TLDR: they are inflating even if they are lying to themselves and others about it.

"banking turmoil has seen officials effectively undo quantitative tightening."

In other words, yes they are printing and doing the opposite of "quantitative tightening", even if they're lying about it.
