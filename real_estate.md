Fact 2: 

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Sydney's average house price growth over the last 46 years has been 7.9% per annum. 

Fact 3: 

 According to data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the national capital gain over the past 10 years comes to 70%, with an annual growth of 5.61%, which is just shy of the 7% needed in order for a property value to double in a 10-year period.
 
Fact 4: 

If you invested $100 in the S&P 500 at the beginning of 1900, you would have about $9,789,827.58 at the end of 2023, assuming you reinvested all dividends. This is a return on investment of 9,789,727.58%, or 9.79% per year.

This lump-sum investment beats inflation during this period for an inflation-adjusted return of about 273,249.79% cumulatively, or 6.64% per year.
